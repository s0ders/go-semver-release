# Workflow examples

## Versioning workflow

Since Go Semver Release is CI agnostic, this page aims to give a few examples of CI workflows that you can implement to benefit the most out of this program.

A typical workflow versioning your repository using Go Semver Release would look like this:

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'neutral'}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    participant Build
    participant Tests
    participant Versioning
    participant Release
    Build->>Tests: Passes
    Tests--xBuild: Fail
    Tests->>Versioning: Passes
    Versioning-->>Build: No new release
    Versioning->>Release: New release
```

### Workflow example

{% hint style="warning" %}
Usually, the first step in a CI/CD job is to clone (or "checkout") the repository on which the workflow will operate. When doing so, the checkout step usually has a `depth` property allowing you to fetch tags. Make sure that all annotated tags are fetched otherwise the program will not be able to detect previous semantic version tags.
{% endhint %}

Below are simple pipeline examples for various CI providers:

* [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/s0ders/go-semver-release/blob/main/docs/examples/github-actions-remote-mode.yml) using remote mode
* [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/s0ders/go-semver-release/blob/main/docs/examples/github-actions-local-mode.yml) using local mode
